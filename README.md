# DESeq2_Analysis_epithelialCells

RNAseq data analysis using python's DESeq2. Dataset from this paper https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/118/6/1583/6273663#353141440
Original paper used EdgeR for DGE analysis.
RNA sequencing data have been submitted to GEO database under accession number GSE139580.

Experimental setup:
Wild-type and primary cilia-deficient Tg737orpk/orpk arterial ECs were submitted to physiological (30 dynes/cm2) or aneurysmal (2 dynes/cm2) WSS, and unbiased transcriptomics were performed.
